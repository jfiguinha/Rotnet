# Rotnet
Fork of the RotNet Project

I add a cpp project in order to use RotNet in a cpp program without need of TensorFlow and keras framework.

It's very useful for my viewer program in order to correct the picture presentation.

I create this fork in order to explain a working version of this very interesting program.

Initial project : https://github.com/d4nst/RotNet

Blog of the project : https://d4nst.github.io/
